    "In this 5-minute quickstart tutorial, we use cleanlab to find potential label errors in a text classification dataset of [IMDB movie reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). This dataset contains 50,000 text reviews, each labeled with a binary sentiment polarity label indicating whether the review is positive (1) or negative (0). cleanlab will shortlist _hundreds_ of examples that confuse our ML model the most; many of which are potential label errors, edge cases, or otherwise ambiguous examples.\n",

    "- Build a simple TensorFlow & Keras neural network and wrap it with cleanlab's `KerasWrapperSequential`.  This wrapper class  makes *any* Keras/Tensorflow model compatible with scikit-learn (and some advanced cleanlab functionality like `CleanLearning` is easier to run with scikit-learn-compatible models).\n",
